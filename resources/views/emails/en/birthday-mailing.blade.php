Dear Code Week activity organiser,<br/>

This year, we celebrate the 10th anniversary of EU Code Week and we would like to invite you to celebrate with us!<br/>

You have already participated in the past. The 10th edition is a great opportunity to do it again.<br/>

Our aim is to make countries all over the world burst with coding activities between 8 and 23 October. As a community we want to show the world how important it is for people of all ages to learn programming, bring their ideas to life digitally and actively shape the future.<br/>

It is easier than ever to participate in Code Week. We have:<br/>
<ul>
<li>Code Week ambassadors and Leading teachers in many countries.</li>
<li>A website in 29 languages</li>
<li>Many different and fun resources, for example:
<ul>
    <li>Short tutorials and ready-made lesson plans for those with no or little coding experience.</li>
    <li>Coding challenges that you can adapt to your class or group</li>
    <li>A one-stop-shop for free resources to Learn and Teach coding</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Podcasts where we explore a range of topics from robotics and AI to media literacy and computational thinking in education.</li>
<li>Inspirational blog posts created by the community</li>
<li>The Code Week Teachers Facebook group with tens of thousands of energetic teachers passionate about coding.</li>
</ul>

We would be thrilled if you decide to take active part in Code Week again!<br/>

If you do, please add all your coding activities on the Code Week map!<br/>

In case you need a hand, join us on 8 September at a virtual community event on Facebook and Youtube.<br/>

Thanks for taking part!<br/>

Best regards,<br/>

Annika Ã–stergren Pofantis on behalf of the EU Code Week community<br/><br/>
