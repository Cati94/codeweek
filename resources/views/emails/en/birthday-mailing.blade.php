Dear Code Week activity organiser,<br/>

This year, we celebrate the 10th anniversary of <a href="https://codeweek.eu/">EU Code Week</a> and we would like to invite you to celebrate with us!<br/>

You have already participated in the past. The 10th edition is a great opportunity to do it again.<br/>

Our aim is to make countries all over the world burst with coding activities between 8 and 23 October. As a <a href="https://codeweek.eu/community">community</a> we want to show the world how important it is for people of all ages to learn programming, bring their ideas to life digitally and actively shape the future.<br/>

It is easier than ever to participate in Code Week. We have:<br/>
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://codeweek.eu/community">Code Week ambassadors and Leading teachers</a> in many countries.</li>
    <li>A <a href="https://codeweek.eu/">website</a> in 29 languages</li>
<li>Many different and fun resources, for example:
<ul>
    <li><a href="https://codeweek.eu/training">Short tutorials and ready-made lesson plans</a> for those with no or little coding experience.</li>
    <li><a href="https://codeweek.eu/challenges">Coding challenges</a> that you can adapt to your class or group</li>
    <li>A one-stop-shop for free resources to <a href="https://codeweek.eu/resources">Learn</a> and <a href="https://codeweek.eu/resources/teach">Teach coding</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
    <li><a href="https://codeweek.eu/podcasts">Podcasts</a> where we explore a range of topics from robotics and AI to media literacy and computational thinking in education.</li>
    <li>Inspirational <a href="https://blog.codeweek.eu/">blog posts</a> created by the community</li>
    <li>The <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/eucodeweekteachers">Code Week Teachers Facebook group</a> with tens of thousands of energetic teachers passionate about coding.</li>
</ul>

We would be thrilled if you decide to take active part in Code Week again!<br/>
