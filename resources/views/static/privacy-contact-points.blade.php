                bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data (repealing Regulation (EC) No
                45/2001).</p>

                your personal information to facilitate the identification of contact points by the public or
                stakeholders. Offering contacts with individuals rather than functional mailboxes is often the best and
                most efficient way to ensure that interested people can get in contact with Commission services or with
                the relevant contact points (national authorities, stakeholders, etc.).</p>
