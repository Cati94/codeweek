                        EU Code Week Challenges are activities that you can do on your own, in the classroom, with
                        colleagues or friends. You would like to participate in Code Week but do not really have an idea
                        of what to organize? Look no further! We have designed along with Code Week partners a selection
                        of easy to make challenges, that include concrete examples of how to use it in a classroom or
                        group. There are also guidelines on how to complete the challenges, but you can adapt them so
                        that they suit the needs, interests and age of your participants. You can use whatever tools and
                        technologies you like, but we recommend open-source resources.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Choose one or several challenges, adapt it to your group or your classroom, and share the
                        results on Instagram to encourage even more colleagues and friends to engage in the Code Week
                        fun!
